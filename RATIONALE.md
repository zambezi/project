Zambezi Project
===============

Whenever you're starting a project, there are about a million questions that need to be answered – some of them inevitable end up having to be answered for every project:

- What license should we pick?
- How should we structure the readme?
- Where do we put author information?
- What about how to contribute back?

Those questions, and some others, are what this template project is trying to answer. It's not universal – some projects will necessarily have to clone and heavily modify this template – but it's a solid starting point for almost any project, and certainly software development projects. It should also be useful as the foundation for other project templates.

Ideally the information in this project template is kept as structured as possible, such that most of it can be processed not only by a human, but also by machines. For instance, the use of widely known file names such as [README](README.md) and [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) may be used by machines to pick out introductory documentation and license information, and the contents of [SUMMARY](SUMMARY.md) may be used to generate navigable documentation for various purposes.

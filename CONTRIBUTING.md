Contributing to Zambezi Open Source Projects
============================================

You're very welcome to contribute to Zambezi open source projects. Any and all contributions are welcome.

By contributing to any Zambezi open source project, you implicitly agree to the contribution terms set forth in this notice. If you do *not* approve of these terms, you must *not* contribute to Zambezi open source projects.

Issues
------

Issues and enhancement requests are very welcome, as well as general discussion. Please follow our code of conduct, as explained later in this document, by being respectful and inclusive in your contributions.

Contributing
------------

Zambezi open source projects follow the "fork-and-pull" model of open source development:

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

**NOTE**: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

Copyright & Licensing
---------------------

Please see the [license](LICENSE.md) for detailed licensing and copyright information.

Zambezi does not require you to assign the copyright of your contributions, and you retain the copyright. However, in order to be included in this and potentially other projects, your contributions *must* also be made available under the same [license](LICENSE.md) as this project.

If you do *not* agree with these terms, you must *not* make your contributions available. Unless *explicitly* stated otherwise, you agree to these terms simply by making your contributions available for inclusion in this project.

### FAQ

**Q:** I'm contributing on behalf of my employer, is this ok?
**A:** So long as you have the legal authority to make contributions and your employer agrees with the terms, we will happily accept contributions!

**Q:** Can I contribute code or other material created by others?
**A:** Maybe, but please *do not assume you can*. Any contributions you make must be made available under the [same license as the project](LICENSE.md) and you *must* make sure you have the legal authority to make this contribution. If in doubt, please refrain from contributing or contact the original author to get their explicit approval.

**Q:** Can I contribute code or other material under a different license?
**A:** No. Any contributions *must* be made available under the [same license as the project](LICENSE.md).

**Q:** What does your license even mean?
**A:** The license sets out the terms under which you may use or reference this project. If you're in any doubt about it you should definitely consider seeking legal advice from a lawyer or other legal representative.

Code of Conduct
---------------

With any contribution to this or other Zambezi open source projects, please make every effort to make this a nice experience for everyone.

Please **be open** with your contributions, by not using private communications whenever possible. Also **be concise**, and whenever long form discussions are required, add a summary where appropriate.

Additionally, it's important to **assume good faith** when working together. Your way of working may be different from that of others, so try your best to **be collaborative** and assume you are working toward the same goals.

As collaborators may be from any part of the world and of any cultural heritage, we ask that you **be inclusive** and most importantly **be respectful!** Harassment or abuse of any kind will not be tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable for any reason, and do not feel there's any construction means to resolve the situation, please do not hesitate to contact any [Zambezi team member](https://github.com/orgs/zambezi/people) to help you out.
